# C++
C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

## Topics to be Covered:
1. **Static Member Fucntion**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Virtual and Abstract Classes**
4. **Virtual Function**
5. **Polymorphism**
6. **Inheritance based polymorphism**
7. **Operator Overloading**(will Try to cover maximum operators)
8. **File Handeling Using OOPS concepts in C++**
## Current Objectives:

1. **This is repo I created for adding files which contains different concepts of OOPS in C++.**
2. **Add Comments in your **.cpp** Files briefly mentioning Which Concept you are using and how is it working.** :)
3. **Try to also show some other approaches by which, the question you are trying to solve, can be solved.**
4. **You can add A new folder named same as your username, containing your file, so that it is easier for others to see your contributions.**
5. **You can also add subfolders in your own folder to differentiate different topics of OOPS.**
5. **Your Contribution is Appriciated.**

## Future Goals:
1. **Make this repo not only limited to OOPS concepts but also include DSA and DP concepts in it.**
2. **Maintain this repo with a proper structure.**
